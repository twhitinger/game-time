# Lyger Woods 2017

## Description

Lyger Woods 2017 is a miniature golf game written in JavaScript, and utilizing the HTML canvas for all gameplay. The game can be played [here](https://concach.github.io/game-time).

## Playing instructions

Within a round, the user input is accepted by press-hold-release of the space bar. While the space bar is pressed down, the player can see the current input - either a power meter, or a direction pointer. The power meter affects how hard the ball is struck, and the direction meter gives input for the direction of the hit.

One the player makes the ball in the hole, a new hole is displayed. Once the player has played all the holes, a final score is displayed.

This game was created from a fork of the [Gametime Starter Kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/game-time-starter-kit) by [Chris Concannon](https://www.github.com/concach) and [Trent Whitinger](https://www.github.com/twhitinger).
